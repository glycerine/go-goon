go-goon
=======

Go-goon is a WIP Go implementation of [goon](https://github.com/shurcooL/goon).

Go-goon currently works for only _SOME_ of the inputs, and likely panics and produces wrong results for many others. There are some things hardcoded and unfinished, so at this time it's not production ready. I plan to fix problems and add missing functionality as I use it in other situations and notice it break.

Go-goon source was based on the existing source of go-spew by Dave Collins. Thank you so much Dave! (I'm not very experienced with dealing with licenses, so if I've done something wrong, please let me know politely and I will politely try to fix it; my intentions are to bring the most value to all humans and I mean no harm.)
